# Phase4-NLP

This repo was created as part of a project for the Flatiron School Data Science course. Per the course website, the suggested task is to:

    "Build a model that can rate the sentiment of a Tweet based on its content."

Although we may refine this task as time allows.


# The Data

The data for this project was provided by data.world, and can be found here: https://data.world/crowdflower/brands-and-product-emotions

The data set contains 9093 tweets about tech products that human raters have flagged as either positive, negative, or neutral.

For the moment, our plan is to train a model to a. identify what product a tweet might be discussing, and then b. determine what sort of sentiment the the tweet expresses. Having such a model would allow PR teams to scan for tweets that might relate to their products and react to potencial swings in sentiment, especially around particular updates or events that might prompt changes to overall sentiment towards their products.
